      <h2>HTML Basics Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines
        the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as
        <span class="bold-text">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> and
        scripting languages such as JavaScript. [Wikipedia]
      </p>
      <ul class="summary-list">
        <li class="list-mark-vertical-line">
          <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
            local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
            originally included cues for its appearance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
            constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
            be embedded into the rendered page.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-mark-vertical-line">
          <p>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
            JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-mark-vertical-line">
          <p>
            HTML markup consists of several key components, including those
            called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types,
            character references and entity references. HTML tags most
            commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although
            some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example
            &lt;img&gt;.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the
            tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for
            sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style
            information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags
            such as the &lt;img&gt; used to embed images, the reference to the
            image resource in the format like this: &lt;img
            src="example.com/example.jpg"&gt;
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>CSS Basics Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
          markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
          SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. [Wikipedia]
        </p>
        <ul class="summary-list">
          <li class="list-mark-vertical-line">
            <p>
              CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
              presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set
              consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-mark-vertical-line">
            <p>
              The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
              determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration
              of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority
              scheme is predictable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-mark-vertical-line">
            <p>
              Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can
              include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class
              may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may
              only be applied to a single element.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting
              based on information that is not contained in the document tree.
              One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which
              identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible
              element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is
              appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
